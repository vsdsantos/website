Hello! Welcome to my page. I'm a passionate student in the aerospace engineering field and currently works as a
stress analysis intern at Embraer. My research interests includes
aerospace structures, composite and laminated structures, aeroelasticity and novel computational
methods.

I've worked, so far, with software development (academic and professionally) and with project management. Mostly technologies that I'm used to work are Python, Julia, C#, JS and VBA. Furthermore, I've experience in FEM modelling of metallic and composite
structures in Nastran with Femap and Altair software suits.
