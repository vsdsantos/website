abstract: Panel Flutter is an aeroelastic instability of plates and shells of aerospace vehicles. The phenomena have recently grown of interest as the increased efforts to make supersonic and hypersonic flight viable in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Many results are available in the literature using customized programs to study panel flutter with non-linear structural and aerodynamics models. In this work, the third-order Piston Theory is used in the supersonic panel flutter analysis and an evaluation of the NASTRAN capabilities. Later, the mesh convergence study and, subsequentially, the flutter analysis of a metallic and a composite laminated plate is performed. The obtained results show a good agreement with the literature and, therefore, demonstrate the capability of the methodology for the cases developed in this work.
