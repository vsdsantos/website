abstract: The given paper describes and verifies the possibilities of a pre-processing and post-processing method to model supersonic panel flutter problem through Finite Element Method on NASTRAN solver.  The aerodynamic model uses a discretized third-order Piston Theory. The method utilizes the Python Language Framework to pre-process the model and post-process the results.  The aeroelastic instability boundary, known as flutter, is investigated in a sample problem of a flat square plate under supersonic flow.
