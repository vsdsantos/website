Undergraduate Research project under the [Aerospace Structure's Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Helio-Pegado-Lab)
oriented by [Professor D.Eng. Helio Pegado](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helio-Pegado).

## Description
Research on the Panel Flutter phenomena on
aerospace structures. Developing a pre-processor, aerodynamic mesh
generation and post-processor method, to model a supersonic panel
flutter on Nastran solver. Flutter is investigated numerically in
metallic and composite plates;

Using Python and Nastran;
