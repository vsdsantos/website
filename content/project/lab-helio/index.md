Undergraduate Research project;

Description â€“ Research on the Panel Flutter phenomena on
aerospace structures. Developing a pre-processor, aerodynamic mesh
generation and post-processor method, to model a supersonic panel
flutter on Nastran solver. Flutter is investigated numerically in
metallic and composite plates;

Papers: COBEM 2019 and CILAMCE 2020;

Techs: Python, Nastran and Femap;
